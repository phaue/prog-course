Calculations done using complex numbers:

sqrt of -1 = 6.12e-17+1i

sqrt of i = 0.707+0.707i

e to the i = 0.54+0.841i

e to i*pi = -1+1.22e-16i

i to the i = 0.208+0i

Log of i = 0+1.57i

sin(i*pi) = 0+11.5i

Now we check if the calculated values are the same as the correct values: 

is sqrt of -1 correct?: True

is Log of i correct?: True

is sqrt of i correct?: True

is i to the i correct?: True
