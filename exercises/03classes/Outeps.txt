Epsilon exercise
Task 1: Maximum/minimum representable intergers
my max int = 2147483647
max int value = 2147483647
my min int = -2147483648
min int value = -2147483648
 
Task 2: The machine epsilon
The double machine epsilon was found to be 2.22044604925031E-16 and it should be around 2.22044604925031E-16
The float machine epsilon was found to be 1.192093E-07 and it should be around 1.19209289550781E-07
 
Task 3: tiny=epsilon/2
a==b ? False
a>1  ? False
b>1  ? True
1+tiny+tiny is therefore not larger than one and tiny+tiny+1 is. 
This is because two doubles in a finite digit representation can only be compared with the given absolute and/or relative precision
So when comparing 1 and tiny+tiny we lose precision because 1 cannot be compared to tiny and then tiny again, but in the reverse order it is okay because tiny can be related to tiny first and then we add 1.
 
Task 4: Comparing doubles
Are 0.1+0.1...(8 times) the same as 8*0.1 according to ==? d1==d2 ? => False
Are 0.1+0.1...(8 times) the same as 8*0.1 according to approx function? True
