vector v times 2 = 2 4 6

vector u times 3 = 12 15 18

vector v + u = 5 7 9

vector v minus u = -3 -3 -3

vector v negated = -1 -2 -3

The vec other method of calculating the dot product gives: 32
The dot vec1,vec2 method of calculating the dot product gies: 32
The two approx methods are chronologically given as True and True
