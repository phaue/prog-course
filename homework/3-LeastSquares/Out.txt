c vector gives: 
      4.96     -0.171 
Error matrix gives: 

   0.00125  -0.000197 
 -0.000197   5.12e-05 
The half-life can be found for the formula TÂ½=ln(2)/lambda which in this case gives: 
4.06242368851649 +- 0.170393518471826  days
And the experimental halflife is 3.631 days, which means the found halflife is slightly wrong and not within the uncertainty
